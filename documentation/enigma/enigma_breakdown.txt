ENIGMA MACHINE BREAKDOWN

A basic version of Enigma Consists of:
    - Rotors
    - Plugboard Swtiches
    - Mirroring 
    - Text Input
    - Text Output


Note: The state (setting) of the Enigma machine changes (increments) for each key press.


Rotors:
    - Cycle from numbers 1-26, corresponding to letter positions in the alphabet
    - Each rotor represents a isomorphism of letters unto letters
        - However, no letter maps to itself (Critical flaw in Enigma design) 
    - Each rotor increments when the preceding rotor has completed a full cycle.

Plugboard:
    - Swaps two letters 
        - (i.e. If A -> M and K -> X originally, then connecting A <-> K will map A -> X and K -> M).
    - 13 connections available

Mirroring:
    - circuit is reversed through the rotors.
